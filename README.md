Hello my name is Ivan Zykov.

I'm a back-end developer located in Vienna, Austria. I have experience as a PHP full stack developer and I'm transitioning to Java now.

#### Some of my pet projects I did recently:
- [udacity-hotel-reservation-app](https://github.com/IvanZet/udacity-hotel-reservation-app), the first project I did during Udacity Java Programming nanodegree
- [udacity-udasecurity](https://github.com/IvanZet/udacity-udasecurity), the second project in Udacity Java Programming nanodegree. It is not polished and lacks a
  proper description
- [udacity-parallel-web-crawler](https://github.com/IvanZet/udacity-parallel-web-crawler), the third project in Udacity Java Programming nanodegree. It is not polished
  and also lacks a proper description
- [smaller-web-hexagon](https://github.com/IvanZet/smaller-web-hexagon), my attempt to implement a simple example of hexagon architecture
- [pluralsight-conf-demo], my first simple CRUD app in Spring Bootstrap

I'm looking for a full-time position of Java software engineer in Vienna.
